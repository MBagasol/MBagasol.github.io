Ever since I was in highschool, I always wanted to be like the people who were in front of the computer screen typing up a bunch of crazy stuff and make things happen, like one of the main guys in the TV show the Blacklist! But, while I was in highschool I didn't know where to begin. My highschool, Harmony Magnet Academy, was very engineerinng based. All everybody knew how to do was "physical" engineering related. Software Engineering was stuff the IT guy did at my highschool. 

So when I got out of highschool, I went to Fresno State University for Mechanical Engineering. I then dropped out three weeks later due to it being too expensive.... I then started my job as an EMT. I've been an EMT for almost 4 years now, and it has been very rewarding. But about 2 years ago, I ended up starting a family. Now, being an EMT is very rewarding in its own right, but you do not make enough to sustain a family(at least where I'm from). So I decided to go back to school for Civil Engineering. While I was doing my due dilligence about the field, I stumbled upon the YouTube channel EngineeredTruth! Some of you may know about that channel, but it's what opened my eyes to Software Engineering as a more viable field as opposed to classic engineering. I then made the jump. I started at FreeCodeCamp to see how I would like it. I LOVED IT!! 

I was addicted to learning to code, and that was what ultimately lead me astray. I ended up wanting to learn so much, that I had no structure. So it was at this point I decided I wanted to get my Computer Science Degree. It was also at this point that I decided I needed a more structured format to help me learn better. That is when I found Flatiron Academy! Currently I'm about three weeks into to the coding bootcamp, and I love it! I can feel myself understanding the material a lot better than when I was going about teaching myself! 

All in all, that is how I ended up where I am at today!
